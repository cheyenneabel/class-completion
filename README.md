# Class Completion
#### Module 1 - Week 2

## Assignment Instructions
Uncomment the tests in the `SavingsAccountTest` one at a time, sequentially.
Start at the top of the test class and work your way down one test at a time.
These tests will drive out the creation of a `SavingsAccount` class.

If all the tests pass you will have built a `SavingsAccount` class that has the following features:
 - A starting balance
 - An account number
 - The ability to add money to the account
 - The ability to withdraw money from the account
 - The ability to add interest to the account balance.  (This is a super bank account and accrues interest whenever you call the method to accrue interest!)
 - Not fulfilling a withdraw if the withdraw would put the balance below 0.
